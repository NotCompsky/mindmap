## Features

* Very fast
  * It uses WebGL and optimised JavaScript
  * Alternatives tend to use SVG or very abstract (and inefficient) libraries, which don't scale well for thousands of nodes
* Very robust
  * Browsers tend to unload WebGL after a long time if you change tabs - you can still save or export your data if this occurs
* Import and export (as JSON files)
* Layout is automatically generated
  * Nodes never overlap
  * Nodes scale according to the size available to them and their descendants
* Nodes can be moved from one 'parent' to another
* Nodes can also have siblings
* RegEx and normal search

## Alternatives

* [My Mind](https://github.com/drichard/mindmaps)
  * Freezes when it reaches thousands of nodes, with no ability to save your changes
  * Can import from this, using `import-from-mymind.py`
