## Features

* Very fast
  * It uses WebGL and optimised JavaScript
  * Alternatives tend to use SVG or very abstract (and inefficient) libraries, which don't scale well for thousands of nodes
* Very robust
  * Browsers tend to unload WebGL after a long time if you change tabs - you can still save or export your data if this occurs
* Import and export (as JSON files)
* Layout is automatically generated
  * Nodes never overlap
  * Nodes scale according to the size available to them and their descendants
* Nodes can be moved from one 'parent' to another
* Nodes can also have siblings
* RegEx and normal search

## Uses

What this software is for:

* To represent *huge* mindmaps
* To represent mindmaps that are not simple trees
  * Which have parent, child *and* sibling relations
* It feels most natural when nodes have titles
  * Each node only displays its first line of text, until it is clicked on

What this software lacks:

* Presentation style
  * It only renders Unicode characters
  * It's not pretty enough for PowerPoint presentations
* Version control

* MarkMap â€¢ [Code](https://github.com/markmap/markmap) â€¢ [Example](https://markmap.js.org/repl)
  * ðŸ”´ Uses SVG, so:
    * ðŸ”´ it cannot handle thousands of nodes
  * ðŸŸ¢ Converts MarkDown text into a mindmap, so:
    * ðŸŸ¢ it can be used with version control utilities (e.g. `git`)
    * ðŸŸ¢ it can place inline HTML (tables, LaTex) into the mindmap
  * Similar to [dundalek's MarkMap](https://github.com/dundalek/markmap) but serves the opposite purpose
* MyMind by OndÅ™ej Å½Ã¡ra â€¢ [Code](https://github.com/ondras/my-mind) â€¢ [Example](https://my-mind.github.io/?url=examples%2Ffeatures.mymind)
  * ðŸ”´ Uses SVG, so:
    * ðŸ”´ it cannot handle thousands of nodes
    * ðŸŸ¢ it supports rich text formatting (hyperlinks, colours)
  * ðŸŸ¢ Nodes can do basic math operations
  * ðŸŸ¢ Undo/redo

* Mindmaps by David Richard â€¢ [Code](https://github.com/drichard/mindmaps) â€¢ [Example](https://www.mindmaps.app/)
  * ðŸ”´ Uses SVG, so:
    * ðŸ”´ it cannot handle thousands of nodes
  * ðŸ”´ No ability to save your changes when SVG crashes (to save RAM, browsers often unload SVG/WebGL assets without unloading the page)
  * Can import from this, using `import-from-mymind.py`
